# Prework - *Background Color Changer*

Submitted by: **Ria Kapoor**

**The Background Color Changer** is an app that changes the background to a random color after the user presses the "Change Background" button. In addition, the app lists some of the personal info of the developer, including the developer's name, school, and aspirational job. 

Time spent: 1 hour spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button

    - The ability to order food at any of Duke's dining locations (useful for ordering food in between classes)
    - Features to customize the dishes by adding or removing ingredients
    - Uses dining plan dollars when ordering food
-  Example App: **Uber**
    - Adding stops along the way when riding with multiple people
    - Ratings and reviews on drivers give a sense of what to expect from the driver
    - Easy to tip driver for service
 
I think a useful app to build would be a ridesharing app for college students. My university does not provide transportation to and from our airport during break and as a result, most students use an app like Uber or Lyft to get to the airport. The cost of the ride can be upwards of $40 and students often struggle to find people with similar flight times to carpool with. An app that allows students to enter what airport they are going to, what time they want to get to the airport, and their contact information would be useful in finding students to carpool with. There can also be a security feature to verify a school email address in order to limit the app to only college students. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I faced a challenge when uploading my files to GitHub. I'm familiar with GitLab but hadn't had much experience creating a local repository and uploading it to a GitHub repository. I struggled a bit with this but was eventually able to upload my project to GitHub.
